Latent Dirichlet Allocation Algorithm
=====================================

This is a Java implementation of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm using Gibbs sampling technique.

To learn how LDA works, read David Blei & Andrew Ng paper:

One essential problem in NLP is to model a collection of documents.  In particular, one might be interested in extracting underlying topics from a collection of documents.  LDA models a document as a bag of words in which words (w's) are the observed variables while topics are the latent variables.

## How to build/run LDA project?
LDA is a Maven project. If you use Eclipse with Maven plugin, you need to import LDA as a Maven project and build it from there.
